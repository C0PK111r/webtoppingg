# Surfly Labs: annotations

This is a simple app for adding [annotatorJS](annotatorjs.org)-like annotations on any web page.
To make it work, just drop a built JS file on the page.

This app is a part of the [Surfly Labs experiment](https://www.surfly.com/extend-any-web-app-with-annotations/),
but works standalone as well.
